Tutorials and resources for the Creality CP-01 3-in-one printer

## Availalbe Guides
The Creality CP-01 is an extremely versatile 3-in-1 machine that can 3D print, CNC mill, and laser etch & engrave. It comes with three heads that are easily interchanged with one another, and can be used by the hobbyist that is looking to own just one machine for making a variety of projects and mediums instead of having to own two or even three machines. The following guides will be available on this github: 

1) Slicing and printing 3D objects
2) CNC carving a 3D wood relief pattern
3) CNC carving a PCB circuit board prototype 
4) Laser etching patterns and creating laser outlines

## Software 
To take advantage of our guides, you will have to download some software to fully utilize the different aspects of the machine.
